# Notes on type-driven development in Idris

This repository holds documents for a short-course on type-driven
development with the Idris language.

It requires [Idris 1.3.2](http://idris-lang.org), [Python
3](http://python.org) and [Atom Editor](http://atom.io) to run the examples. Pandoc is
required to build the pdf from sources.
